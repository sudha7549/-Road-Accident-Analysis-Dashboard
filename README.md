# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard



**Future Intern - Data Analyst Internship**

## üö¶ Overview
As part of my Data Analyst Internship at **Future Intern**, I designed and developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize road accident data from the UK. This project aims to identify patterns, key trends, and potential risk factors associated with road accidents, improving the ability to make data-driven decisions for safety and policy initiatives.

The dashboard covers multiple dimensions, including accident severity, vehicle types, accident locations, weather conditions, and light conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. **Total Casualties and Accidents (CY vs PY)**
- Displays a year-over-year comparison of total casualties and accidents, showing the percentage change for each category.

### 2. **Monthly Trend Analysis**
- A line and area chart visualizing the **CY vs PY casualties** over the months to track performance and seasonal trends.

### 3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**
- Visual representation of casualty counts for each **vehicle type**, including cars, bikes, buses, vans, and more, helping to understand the impact of different vehicles on road safety.

### 4. **Urban vs Rural Split**
- A donut chart highlighting the distribution of accidents between **urban** (61.95%) and **rural** (38.05%) areas.

### 5. **Geospatial Mapping**
- An interactive map that displays accident locations using **latitude and longitude**, enabling a visual overview of high-incident areas across the UK.

### 6. **Casualties by Road Type**
- A bar chart that shows the number of casualties based on different **road types** like Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabout, etc.

### 7. **Light Condition Impact**
- A donut chart indicating the effect of **light conditions** on accident severity (e.g., 73.84% of accidents occurred during daylight).

### 8. **Dynamic Filtering**
- Users can filter data by **Road Surface** and **Weather Conditions** using slicers, allowing for customized insights.
